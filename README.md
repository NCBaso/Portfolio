- **B.Sc.H in Botany & Environmental Science:** Rhodes University (2013-2017)
- **Matric (Bachelor) with an A in Life Science:** Ncedolwethu S.S.S (2009-2013)

## Work Experience

- **Postdoc Fellow:** South African Institute for Aquatic Biodiversity (May 2024 - Present)
  - Topic: Unveiling the Tangled Web: Climate Change, Invasive Species, and Trophic Cascades in Aquatic Ecosystems
- **Lab Assistant, Senior Demonstrator, ADP Tutor, and Augmenting Lecturer:** Rhodes University (2016-2023)
- **Research Assistant:** Albany Museum, Grahamstown (Dec 2015 – Feb 2016)
